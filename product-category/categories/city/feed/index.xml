					<description><![CDATA[This product type lets you add variations to the same product to create a complex, variable product. Each variation of the product has its own price, SKU, available stock, etc. eg: A shirt or t-shirt with different sizes and different colors.

While creating the product, you can select the ‘Variable product’ option from the drop-down. To be able to create different variations, you will have to set up attributes and define values to each of them. You can use different attributes and values to create variations. After that, you can manually create available variations or create all possible variations in one go. You can update individual details for each variation, after all required variations are created.]]></description>

Trek’s Removable Integrated Battery (RIB) system looks great and is super user-friendly: it fully hides the battery in the frame for protection, makes it easy remove the battery without tools and lets you mount a water bottle cage.</p>
<p>This bike expands boundaries: the top-notch Bosch system is equally suited to commuting, recreation, and a ridiculously fun time on the trails.</p>
<p>The Purion controller has Walk Assist and an intelligent eMTB mode that automatically delivers the right amount of power based on your terrain.</p>
<p>It’s equipped with an external charging port for easy charging on or off the bike.</p>
<p>You can boost your Powerfly’s utility by adding a rack and fenders, plus built-in wiring lets you easily install lights powered by the motor</p>
